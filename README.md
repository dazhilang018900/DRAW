## DRAW
This is a reimplementation of a paper called DRAW (Deep Recurrent Attention Writer) in Tensorflow, the original paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.04623

This paper uses a bunch of technologies namely a Variational Autoencoder, a Recurrent Neural Network (lstm cell) and Gaussian Attention. 
This model can run with or without attention and my code contains both the versions of it.
